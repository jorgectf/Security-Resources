This repository has been created with the intention to be a community-driven source to be up-to-date with CTF challenges/writeups and Research articles.

Any Pull Request is appreciated! Collaborating is as easy as editing a JSON; [GitHub Actions](https://github.com/features/actions) and [the organizer](organizer/gen.py) will do the rest :)
